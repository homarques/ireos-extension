    abstract = {<p>Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected items or events in datasets, which differ from the norm. In contrast to standard classification tasks, anomaly detection is often applied on unlabeled data, taking only the internal structure of the dataset into account. This challenge is known as unsupervised anomaly detection and is addressed in many practical applications, for example in network intrusion detection, fraud detection as well as in the life science and medical domain. Dozens of algorithms have been proposed in this area, but unfortunately the research community still lacks a comparative universal evaluation as well as common publicly available datasets. These shortcomings are addressed in this study, where 19 different unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms are evaluated on 10 different datasets from multiple application domains. By publishing the source code and the datasets, this paper aims to be a new well-funded basis for unsupervised anomaly detection research. Additionally, this evaluation reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches for the first time. Besides the anomaly detection performance, computational effort, the impact of parameter settings as well as the global/local anomaly detection behavior is outlined. As a conclusion, we give an advise on algorithm selection for typical real-world tasks.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a procedure for the detection of multiple outliers in multivariate data. Let X be an n × p data matrix representing n observations on p variates. We first order the n observations, using an appropriately chosen robust measure of outlyingness, then divide the data set into two initial subsets: a `basic' subset which contains p + 1 `good' observations and a `non-basic' subset which contains the remaining n - p - 1 observations. Second, we compute the relative distance from each point in the data set to the centre of the basic subset, relative to the (possibly singular) covariance matrix of the basic subset. Third, we rearrange the n observations in ascending order accordingly, then divide the data set into two subsets: a basic subset which contains the first p + 2 observations and a non-basic subset which contains the remaining n - p - 2 observations. This process is repeated until an appropriately chosen stopping criterion is met. The final non-basic subset of observations is declared an outlying subset. The procedure proposed is illustrated and compared with existing methods by using several data sets. The procedure is simple, computationally inexpensive, suitable for automation, computable with widely available software packages, effective in dealing with masking and swamping problems and, most importantly, successful in identifying multivariate outliers.},

This paper looks at a number of ways of calculating exact Monte Carlo p-values by sequential sampling. Such p-values are shown to have properties similar to those obtained by sampling with a fixed sample size. Both standard and generalized Monte Carlo procedures are discussed and, in particular, a sequential method is proposed for dealing with situations in which values can only be conveniently generated using a Markov chain, conditioned to pass through the observed data.},

  Abstract                 = {Detecting outliers in a multivariate point cloud is not trivial, especially when there are several outliers. The classical identification method does not always find them, because it is based on the sample mean and covariance matrix, which are themselves affected by the outliers. That is how the outliers get masked. To avoid the masking effect, we propose to compute distances based on very robust estimates of location and covariance. These robust distances are better suited to expose the outliers. In the case of regression data, the classical least squares approach masks outliers in a similar way. Also here, the outliers may be unmasked by using a highly robust regression method. Finally, a new display is proposed in which the robust regression residuals are plotted versus the robust distances. This plot classifies the data into regular observations, vertical outliers, good leverage points, and bad leverage points. Several examples are discussed.},

abstract="The evaluation of unsupervised outlier detection algorithms is a constant challenge in data mining research. Little is known regarding the strengths and weaknesses of different standard outlier detection models, and the impact of parameter choices for these algorithms. The scarcity of appropriate benchmark datasets with ground truth annotation is a significant impediment to the evaluation of outlier methods. Even when labeled datasets are available, their suitability for the outlier detection task is typically unknown. Furthermore, the biases of commonly-used evaluation measures are not fully understood. It is thus difficult to ascertain the extent to which newly-proposed outlier detection methods improve over established methods. In this paper, we perform an extensive experimental study on the performance of a representative set of standard k nearest neighborhood-based methods for unsupervised outlier detection, across a wide variety of datasets prepared for this purpose. Based on the overall performance of the outlier detection methods, we provide a characterization of the datasets themselves, and discuss their suitability as outlier detection benchmark sets. We also examine the most commonly-used measures for comparing the performance of different methods, and suggest adaptations that are more suitable for the evaluation of outlier detection results.",

This paper develops a useful correspondence between any hierarchical system of such clusters, and a particular type of distance measure. The correspondence gives rise to two methods of clustering that are computationally rapid and invariant under monotonic transformations of the data. In an explicitly defined sense, one method forms clusters that are optimally ``connected,'' while the other forms clusters that are optimally ``compact.''",

title="On the evaluation of unsupervised outlier detection: measures, datasets, and an empirical study",
journal="Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery",

abstract="The evaluation of unsupervised outlier detection algorithms is a constant challenge in data mining research. Little is known regarding the strengths and weaknesses of different standard outlier detection models, and the impact of parameter choices for these algorithms. The scarcity of appropriate benchmark datasets with ground truth annotation is a significant impediment to the evaluation of outlier methods. Even when labeled datasets are available, their suitability for the outlier detection task is typically unknown. Furthermore, the biases of commonly-used evaluation measures are not fully understood. It is thus difficult to ascertain the extent to which newly-proposed outlier detection methods improve over established methods. In this paper, we perform an extensive experimental study on the performance of a representative set of standard k nearest neighborhood-based methods for unsupervised outlier detection, across a wide variety of datasets prepared for this purpose. Based on the overall performance of the outlier detection methods, we provide a characterization of the datasets themselves, and discuss their suitability as outlier detection benchmark sets. We also examine the most commonly-used measures for comparing the performance of different methods, and suggest adaptations that are more suitable for the evaluation of outlier detection results.",

abstract ={Motivation: Clustering is a useful exploratory technique for the
  analysis of gene expression data. Many different heuristic
  clustering algorithms have been proposed in this context. Clustering
  algorithms based on probability models offer a principled
  alternative to heuristic algorithms. In particular, model-based
  clustering assumes that the data is generated by a finite mixture of
  underlying probability distributions such as multivariate normal
  distributions. The issues of selecting a ‘good’
  clustering method and determining the ‘correct’ number
  of clusters are reduced to model selection problems in the
  probability framework. Gaussian mixture models have been shown to be
  a powerful tool for clustering in many applications.Results: We benchmarked the performance of model-based clustering
  on several synthetic and real gene expression data sets for which
  external evaluation criteria were available. The model-based
  approach has superior performance on our synthetic data sets,
  consistently selecting the correct model and the number of clusters.
  On real expression data, the model-based approach produced clusters
  of quality comparable to a leading heuristic clustering algorithm,
  but with the key advantage of suggesting the number of clusters and
  an appropriate model. We also explored the validity of the Gaussian
  mixture assumption on different transformations of real data. We
  also assessed the degree to which these real gene expression data
  sets fit multivariate Gaussian distributions both before and after
  subjecting them to commonly used data transformations. Suitably
  chosen transformations seem to result in reasonable fits.Availability: Mclust is available at http://www.stat.washington.edu/fraley/mclust.
  The software for the diagonal model is under development.Contact: kayee@cs.washington.eduSupplementary
